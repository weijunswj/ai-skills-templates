# GitHub Programme Web Controller Entry

This is the compact generic direct-entry surface for a fresh Web Controller.
Read it first, then inspect only the target repository's bootstrap and the
pinned contract it names. Do not scan the Toolkit repository.

## Detect the managed repository

In the target repository, read .github/ai-agent-toolkit-programme.json.
Accept it only when the schema is
toolkit.github-program.controller-bootstrap.v1, the profile is
github-managed-programme, the target repository and parent_issue match the
repository under review, and the state/surface schemas, package version,
conformance, and compatibility fields are supported. A v5 repository with a
missing, malformed, stale, unsupported, or mismatched bootstrap is
fail-closed as PARENT_RECONCILIATION_INCOMPLETE.

## Resolve the exact pinned contract

Resolve toolkit_contract.repository, toolkit_contract.revision, and
toolkit_contract.path from the bootstrap. Fetch that exact immutable revision
and path, then verify its SHA-256 equals toolkit_contract.sha256 before using
any programme semantics. Follow the pinned contract for state, surface,
events, the existing durable receipts, migration, projection, and recovery.
The target repository is the programme owner; the toolkit_contract.repository
is only the pinned contract source.

## Required reads and conformance

Read the Parent, every current Child and its epoch/Lock/gate, every current PR
and exact candidate, managed-event history, and the existing durable
github-program-receipt inventory. Also read native Parent/Child membership and
dependencies, PR association, required checks, review decisions, and review
threads. Verify repository, Parent, Child, PR, base, head, tree, version,
authority, epoch, Lock, gate, candidate, fence, receipt, and digest bindings.
For retained v3 event receipt IDs, resolve historical evidence through the
canonical readReceiptById(receiptId) API, derive the run locator only from its
validated durable return, and then readReceiptChain(runId) once per unique
derived run. Do not use snapshot receipt locators, caller-selected runs, or
receipt enumeration; missing or conflicting evidence is fail-closed.

For v4 or legacy state, use the pinned migration rules: preserve historical
comment bytes, retain valid managed events as history, preserve unrelated
issue/PR bytes and native state, and do not infer receipts from prose. A
bootstrap candidate is repository code delivered through the normal PR path;
it is conformance evidence, not a programme Apply operation. Missing, stale,
conflicting, or untrusted facts stop the run with
PARENT_RECONCILIATION_INCOMPLETE.

When the bootstrap is absent, classify legacy or unmanaged state using only
the target repository and this entry surface as discovery and migration
guidance only. Do not infer runtime authority from mutable Toolkit main: it is
never programme semantic authority. Web retains architecture, Lock, material
judgement, G4, and finality authority; the deterministic reconciler alone
writes canonical programme state.
