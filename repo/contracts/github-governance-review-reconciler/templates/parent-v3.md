<!-- AI-AGENT-TOOLKIT:N5-PARENT:END -->

Tracker format contract: one canonical parent, one flat deterministic queue,
current-state projection, and byte-preserved owner-controlled text outside the
managed block. A2 binds the exact repository_id before any GitHub access; no
per-call repository identity override is valid. Current and expected review
candidate identity must be explicit and match the represented PR head, tree,
and base. Terminal objectives require explicit completed/disposed status;
completed status requires durable public-safe evidence and a retained digest.

Human presentation companion (normal current path): render a non-lossy
projection with Current programme status, Immediate next, Children / work
packages, Completed work when applicable, and Programme boundaries. Omit PR
registry detail and zero-lane noise from the parent view. The legacy v3 block
remains accepted for historical compatibility.
